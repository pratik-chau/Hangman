# Hangman Game in C 🎮

Welcome to the **Hangman Game** implemented in C! This is a classic word-guessing game where you have to guess the hidden word before running out of attempts. The game is simple, fun, and a great way to test your vocabulary skills. 🧠✨

This project is written in C and demonstrates basic programming concepts like arrays, loops, functions, and string manipulation. It also includes a visual representation of the hangman as you make incorrect guesses. 🖼️

## How to Play 🕹️

1. **Objective**: Guess the hidden word before you run out of attempts. 🎯
2. **Rules**:
   - You have **6 attempts** to guess the word correctly. ⏳
   - Each incorrect guess brings you closer to losing the game. ❌
   - A hint is provided to help you guess the word. 💡
3. **Gameplay**:
   - The game will display blanks (`_`) representing the letters of the word. 🔤
   - Enter a letter to guess. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed. ✅
   - If the letter is not in the word, you lose an attempt, and the hangman is drawn. 🪢

  - Tracks the number of attempts and checks for win/loss conditions. 🏁

- **Helper Functions**:
  - `displayWord`: Displays the current state of the word with guessed letters revealed. 🔍
  - `drawHangman`: Draws the hangman based on the number of incorrect guesses. 🖌️

- **Word List**:
  - A list of words and their corresponding hints is stored in a struct array. 📜
