# Hangman Game in C

Welcome to the **Hangman Game** implemented in C! This is a classic word-guessing game where you have to guess the hidden word before running out of attempts. The game is simple, fun, and a great way to test your vocabulary skills. 

This project is written in C and demonstrates basic programming concepts like arrays, loops, functions, and string manipulation. It also includes a visual representation of the hangman as you make incorrect guesses.

## How to Play

1. **Objective**: Guess the hidden word before you run out of attempts.
2. **Rules**:
   - You have **6 attempts** to guess the word correctly.
   - Each incorrect guess brings you closer to losing the game.
   - A hint is provided to help you guess the word.
3. **Gameplay**:
   - The game will display blanks (`_`) representing the letters of the word.
   - Enter a letter to guess. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed.
   - If the letter is not in the word, you lose an attempt, and the hangman is drawn.

## Features

- **Random Word Selection**: The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
- **Hints**: Each word comes with a hint to help you guess.
- **Visual Hangman**: The game displays the hangman as you make incorrect guesses.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple and intuitive interface for players.

## Code Structure

The code is organized into the following components:

- **Main Function**:
  - Handles the game loop, user input, and word selection.
  - Tracks the number of attempts and checks for win/loss conditions.

- **Helper Functions**:
  - `displayWord`: Displays the current state of the word with guessed letters revealed.
  - `drawHangman`: Draws the hangman based on the number of incorrect guesses.

- **Word List**:
  - A list of words and their corresponding hints is stored in a struct array.
